# PostageStampsCollectorApp

My team created an Android fully functional app intended to fully support passionate stamp collectors.
The users can perform the following actions:
- create personal account and login in;
- create their custom stamp collections and add stamps to them;
- access their collections anywhere, anytime, the data being stored in a real-time Firebase DB;
- search other users and view their publicly posted collections;
- view in-depth descriptions about wanted stamps.
